Summary: customary hello world post

I know such flagrant pollution of the namespace isn't exactly *best practice*,
but I pretty much **always** import pylab anyway.. 


```python
from pylab import *
print "hello world"
```

this page will hopefully serve as somewhat of a logbook, mostly
linux/python/vim/tmux and other random hacks.. the sort of stuff I go to
the trouble of figuring out... then forget about, and subsequently wonder
if I documented it somewhere...
